"""
Class for the wilds.

During a quest, the player travels through the wilds and encounters either monsters, fairy fountains, wandering merchants, 
a rest spot, or treasure. Monsters cause a battle to start, fairy fountains heal the player to full health, merchants offer 
a limited selection of disposable items, and treasure gives the player money.
Rest spots allow the player to use items they bought.
